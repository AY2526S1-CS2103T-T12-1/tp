# EduDex User Guide

EduDex is a **desktop app for managing student's contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
EduDex is targeted towards technically-able freelance tutors who find it difficult to manage a large number of student contacts. Using EduDex, tutors can easily add the subjects they teach, organize student information, and schedule lessons efficiently.
If you can type fast, EduDex can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional methods.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your EduDex.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar edudex.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds, with a pop-up asking you to start by adding subjects. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

_Initial start-up of Edudex_

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 sch/Raffles Primary School a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `addsub english` : Adds a subject named `English` to the subject list.
   
   * `addlesson 1 sub/english d/monday start/10:00 end/11:00` : Adds a lesson to the first contact, with a subject of english, day of Monday, and timing from 10:00-11:00
   
   * `editlesson 1 1 d/tuesday` : Edits the first lesson of the first contact, changing day to tuesday
   
   * `find sub/english` : Finds all students with subject English taken 
   
   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/strongInMaths` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/owesMoney`, `t/owesMoney t/strongInScience` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Caution:**
* The edited lesson time must not conflict with:
    * Other lessons of the **same student**.
    * Lessons of **other students** (no overlapping times on the same day).
* If changing the subject, ensure it exists in EduDex (use `addsub` first if needed)
* If a subject has been deleted and a lesson still uses it, you must first change the subject field to a valid subject before editing other fields (day, time)
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** You can edit just one field at a time or multiple fields together.
- `editlesson 1 1 d/Tuesday` — Changes only the day of the first lesson.

### Clearing all students : `clear`

Clears all students and subjects from EduDex.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

EduDex data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the JSON data file

EduDex data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/edudex.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.


The `edudex.json` file defines the **data model** for managing tutees in the EduDex application.
This is intended for power users who wish to edit `edudex.json` without using the GUI.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, EduDex will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the EduDex to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EduDex home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
